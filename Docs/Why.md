# Useless, Pointless, get this crap off the Internet!

Woah there *buddy*! **Calm down**, and take a deep breath.  This is only some random dude online's hobby project, and if you do not see a need for it, then that is fine, you can have that opionion for yourself, and just find another project, and then you won't have to read any of these *extremely* long run-on sentances either.

## Why use this framework?

I feel that more *static websites* are required now than ever.  If you definately don't need a backend server, then perhaps, it might be worth considering having a fully static website, that stores all it's data statically.  This completely eliminates any security risks that come with having server-side programs, such as no longer needing to have even a web-based administration page.  The only way that data is updated on websites which use this framework is through the dedicated desktop application, which may soon also be ported to Puter, making the Framework 100% web-based.  This framework will more or less be designed like a *server-side* framework, and won't do much in terms of the UI, all the UI elements and design are for the developer to create, much like a server-side framework like Django.  The framework merely provides the glue to make developing for it feel like you are developing a server-side app.

Once I have the first parts of the framework completed, along with an example to show how it works, I'm sure it will be a bit easier to understand how the framework works.
