## Use Cases

Here are some scenarios which I thought of, I'm sure there could be many more.

### Interactive Personal Biography

A website where the people who visit learn about you from a more interactive website, similar to what you might see in a *Legend of Zelda* game, where parts of the world are unlocked as you progress through the story.  So, a Biography website could be made in the same vain, as to continuously open up new parts of the website as the visitor keeps digging deeper through it.  The **Adventure Kernel** portion of the framework is completely optional, but you can use it to add a bit more interactivity to your Biography.

### YouTuber self-hosted channel site

Don't want to deal with servers or server fees?  But you still want a website with a similar experience?  Look no further than this framework.  It is being built first and foremost as a framework for building completely static websites that do not require a server, although nothing is really stopping you from using a server as well, that is also possible, so it is a very flexible static website framework that I am going to try and make as easy to learn as possible, so that even people without much coding knowledge should be-able to create at least something that works, as the framework should include most of the more complicated tasks you may have to face if you were to do everything manually.

### Static Blog/Vlog/Database

If you don't mind editing and then uploading a `.json` file to your static web host for each update, then perhaps this could be the right framework for your next static site Blog/Vlog/Database.  There will be an eventual example provided along with the framework which will mimic a very basic blog to get people started down this direction, as it can only get more complex as you take the working example and build up from there.  Can't wait to see what people come up with.  *Sadly nobody ever came, and this project was made in vain.*
