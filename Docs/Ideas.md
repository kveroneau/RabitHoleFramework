## Future Ideas to implement

So, here will be what I am planning on turning this framework into within the next week or so, and I just wanted to jot them all down, so if anybody does stumble upon this repo here, they'll know what to expect from this project.

  * Central Variable Settings/Storage
    - This will be able to be saved and loaded from the browser between sessions.
    - These variables can be initialized to anything at first load, or when no saved data was detected.
  * Global Flags System
    - A Flag is a boolean value, and can be used with custom code to set or check.
    - Can optionally be saved into the above central variable settings, so it can be then saved into the browser.
  * Adventure Kernel
    - A heavily updated version of *Keventure*, and will support more menu options to allow for more interactivity.
    - Items will be able to be checked so the website content can potentially change, such as creating a badge to show
      that they obtained that item.
  * YouTube Video Integration
    - Ever wanted to run your own statically hosted personal video sharing through YouTube site?
    - Go back to the days of **MySpace** where people had fully custom and interactive *spaces*, if you are a YouTuber
      you should consider having a website with interactions keeping visitors coming back for more.

There will of course be a method of expanding it's capabilities, and some of the above will be modules, allowing for a much larger variety of *apps* within the site as more developers create and share more.  At least that's the hope one day.
